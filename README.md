# SchoolGrades
The "School Grades Evaluation System" project aims to assist in assessing students' achievements in various subjects and determining whether they meet the requirements for advancing to the next semester. In this project, we analyze the results of a student named Sam.

First, we collect data on Sam's grades in multiple subjects, such as mathematics, science, English, geology, Polish, and informatics. We then calculate Sam's total grade by summing up all of his grades.

In the project, we assume that the maximum possible total score is 600, so we calculate the percentage of points achieved in relation to the maximum available points.

Finally, we display Sam's result as a percentage, rounding it to the nearest whole number. We check whether Sam passed, which means his percentage is at least 50%.

Additionally, in the project, we check whether Sam participated in sporting activities and display this information.

This project allows for effective monitoring of students' progress and making decisions regarding their promotion to the next semester based on their academic performance and sports activities.
